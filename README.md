# EmergingMidterm

A repository for the Emerging Technologies Midterm. A time bank website, designed to allow users to keep track of their time.

The Time bank allows users to allocate their time in hour increments and allow users to make transactions with their hours.
For example, a user could pay another user 5 hours to teach them how to cook thanksgiving dinner. Users will be able to 
keep track of their transactions and plan their hours.

The time bank utilizes HTML5 & CSS3

To run the time bank, you can access GitHub pages and view the page through it.
